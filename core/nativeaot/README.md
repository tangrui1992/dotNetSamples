# Native AOT compilation sample apps

This folder contains sample code demonstrating how to build apps with Native AOT compilation. The requirements for each sample can be found within the corresponding folder, and each sample can be ran using dotnet publish.

Native AOT compilation is an opt-in publishing mode that compiles apps to native code similar to C/C++/Go/Swift/Rust. Not all .NET code will work with native AOT compilation.

## Prerequisites

Up-to-date prerequisites are in the [runtime repo](https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/blob/main/src/coreclr/nativeaot/docs/prerequisites.md).
